Output either Hello 'Name' or Good Bye 'Name' to the console.
The program should say "Hello" to any name except names that start with a "J" or "j", otherwise, the program should say "Good Bye". So, the final output on the console should look like this:

Hello Yaakov
Good Bye John
Good Bye Jen
Good Bye Jason
Hello Paul
Hello Frank
Hello Larry
Hello Paula
Hello Laura
Good Bye Jim
